# CS 367: Introduction to Data Structures
This directory contains programs I wrote for assignments for a class, CS 367: Introduction to Data Structures, 
at University of Wisconsin-Madison. The following is a description of each program/assignment:

##program1
- What is it?: a simplified version of Reddit. An admin can make changes to the database. Users can browse
posts and upvote or downvote them.
- This is an exercise in: using ArrayLists and using iterators to traverse them.
- Classes I implemented: Karma, Post, Reddit, RedditDB, User
- Main program file to run: Reddit.java

##program2
- What is it?: a simplified version of Amazon.com where users can browse and buy products.
- This is an exercise in: working with linked lists. I implemented a double linked class in DLinkedList.java.
A DLinkedList implements the abstract data type in ListADT.java, which was provided. A DLinkedList consists
of a sequence of Listnodes, the class of which was already provided.
- Classes I implemented: AmazonStore, DLinkedList, InsufficientCreditException, Product, User
- Main program file to run: AmazonStore.java

##program3
- What is it?: a simplified version of a version control system, similar to Git.
- This is an exercise in: working with queues and stacks.
- Classes I implemented: Repo, SimpleQueue, SimpleStack, User, VersionControlApp
- Main program file to run: VersionControlApp.java

##program4
- What is it?: a simplified version of a file system.
- This is an exercise in: working with trees.
- Classes I implemented: Access, FileSystemMain
- Main program file to run: VersionControlApp.java
